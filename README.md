## üöñ Big Data Analysis with Dask ‚Äì NYC Taxi Dataset (2019)

## üìä Project Overview

- This project demonstrates scalable big data processing using **Dask** in Python. We analyze real-world NYC Yellow Taxi trip data (January 2019) in Parquet format and generate insights and visualizations, such as:
            - Average trip distance by hour of the day
            - Top 10 pickup locations by ride count
-Key fields include:
      - Pickup and drop-off datetime
      - Trip distance
      - Pickup location ID (PULocationID)
      - Fare amount

## Dataset Used

- **Source**: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)
- **File**: `yellow_tripdata_2019-01.parquet`
- **Download Link**: [Direct URL](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2019-01.parquet)

The dataset includes detailed records of taxi rides: pickup/dropoff time and location, trip distance, fare, passenger count, and more.

## üéØ Objectives

- Perform distributed analysis using Dask to handle a large dataset.
- Calculate **average trip distance by hour of the day**.
- Identify **top 10 pickup locations** based on total number of rides.
- Visualize results using **Matplotlib** and export charts as `.jpg` files.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- Dask: Parallel data processing
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- PyArrow: Parquet file support
- Pandas-style syntax: Familiar structure with scalable backend

## üìÅ Deliverables

- `taxi_analysis.py`: Code to load, process, and visualize the dataset using Dask.
- `yellow_tripdata_2019-01.parquet`: The dataset file used.
- `avg_trip_distance_by_hour.jpg`: A bar chart showing how average trip distance varies across hours.
- `top_pickup_locations.jpg`: A bar chart showing the top 10 most frequent pickup zones.
- `README.md`: This file, summarizing the project.


## üìä Outputs

- Two visualizations are saved as .jpg: Each chart includes data value labels on the bars.

  - avg_trip_distance_by_hour.jpg: Bar chart of average trip distance for each hour of the day.

## üìà Insights

- **Trip distances** tend to be higher during early morning and evening hours, showing commute-related patterns.
- **Pickup zones with the most rides** are clustered in high-traffic areas, such as central Manhattan (based on PULocationID).

## üß† What I Learned

- How to process large datasets using Dask DataFrames with familiar pandas-like syntax.
- How to efficiently work with Parquet files in big data environments.
- How to create value-labeled charts and export them for reports.
- The importance of visualizing trends in transportation data for insights.

## ‚úÖ Summary
This project highlights how large-scale datasets can be handled efficiently using Dask in a local environment. It also demonstrates how to generate visual insights and store them as image files, making the analysis both scalable and presentable.
